## Overview

defer.tx helps Mantle users save on gas fees. By using ML forecasting to predict future gas prices, defer.tx knows when to wait to send your transaction when gas fees are lower. Use cases include contract deployments, stop losses, token swaps, loan repayments, recurring payments, TWAPs and more. defer.tx is modular so you can build your own plugins to support any use cases you want!
