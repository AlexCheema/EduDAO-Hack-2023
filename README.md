# ⏰ defer.tx

![EduDAO Student Hackathon Banner](./edudao-hackathon-23.png)

## Overview

defer.tx helps Mantle users save on gas fees. By using ML forecasting to predict future gas prices, defer.tx knows when to wait to send your transaction when gas fees are lower. Use cases include contract deployments, stop losses, token swaps, loan repayments, recurring payments, TWAPs and more. defer.tx is modular so you can build your own plugins to support any use cases you want!

## Frontend

The frontend consists of the **live** L1/L2 gas price, and an indication of whether the current gas price is high or low. To keep things simple, we provide our recommended amount of time to wait and how much gas you can save (in the example below this is 42% for waiting 7 minutes).

## Backend

defer.tx uses [Amazon Forecast](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/what-is-forecast.html), a time-series forecasting service based on machine learning (ML) to predict future gas prices. An api endpoint provides an indication of how likely the gas price is to drop in a given time period and by how much by querying the Amazon Forecast service. We downloaded all the historical blocks for Mantle and the corresponding L1 gas fees and fed them into Amazon forecast.
